# Task Management API

A simple REST API built with Java and Spring Boot.

This project is primarily created as a learning project to understand
Java OOP, Spring Boot, backend architecture, database access,
dependency injection, testing, Docker, and related backend concepts.

The business domain is intentionally simple so that the main focus
remains on understanding backend architecture and Spring Boot.
